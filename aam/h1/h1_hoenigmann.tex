\paragraph{Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a good way to keep track of time during the short meditations? Should I set a timer or do the meditation for aslong as I don't get distracted?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Self-study:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary of results:\\
    It seems that there is no connection between the intensity of my headache and whether I did a meditation. During meditating, I feel more aware that I have a headache and afterwards I feel like the headache is less important.
    \item Question: How bad is my headache before and after meditation?
    \item Scale: 0-10 (0 = No headache, 10 = Extremly bad)
