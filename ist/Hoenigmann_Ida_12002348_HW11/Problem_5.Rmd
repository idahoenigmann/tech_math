## Chi-squared-test for independence

```{r}
data <- as.table(rbind(c(10, 5, 5), c(10, 20, 10), c(20, 5, 0)))
dimnames(data) <- list(course = c("calculus", "algebra", "probability"), uni = c("Uni A", "Uni B", "Uni C"))
(Xsq <- chisq.test(data))
```

As the p-value is smaller than alpha (= 0.05) we reject the null hypothesis. This means the lecture preference is dependent on the university on a significant level.
