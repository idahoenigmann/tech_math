From the results of chapter~\ref{chapter:results} it is clear, that the algorithm proposed is does not have enough accuracy to be used. The reasons for this could be multitude. For one there is only limited training data. Using a bigger sample of sleep recordings could improve the results achieved. Secondly a different classification algorithm could be tested. From figure~\ref{fig:pca_output_3d} it looks like a linear separation could be possible between the sleep stages S3, S2 and S1. Awake and REM on the other hand appear more difficult so separate from the rest.

We propose some changes for possible future work.

future work:\\
* use multiple channels at one to determine sleep stage\\
* calculate power spectral density from fft output\\
* use better classification
