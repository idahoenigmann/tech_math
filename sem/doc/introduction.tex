\section{EEG Data and Sleep Stages}
\label{sec:eeg_data_and_sleep_stages}

Ganong~\cite{Ganong1997} describes typical patterns observed in electroencephalogram (EEG) data of a sleeping person. He describes the EEG patterns associated with rapid eye movement~(REM) sleep and non-REM~(NREM) sleep.

NREM sleep is further partitioned into three (although some use four) stages, termed Stage~1 (S1) to Stage~3 (S3). Example EEG data of these different sleep stages can be seen in Figure~\ref{pic:TODO} [TODO image]. The EEG data of these stages is characterized by

\begin{enumerate}[label={S\arabic*:}]
	\item low amplitude, high frequency
	\item appearance of sleep spindles (bursts of higher amplitude, lower frequency waves)
	\item high amplitude, low frequency
\end{enumerate}

In REM sleep the EEG data is that of high frequency and low amplitude patterns, resembling the data observed in alert humans.
