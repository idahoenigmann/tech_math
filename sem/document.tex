A substantial body of scientific research has been devoted to exploring Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The foundation of this method was laid by Pearson\cite{Pearson1901} and Hotelling\cite{Hotelling1933}.

An introduction to PCA as well as a good overview on how to derive the formula used to compute the Principal Components (PC) used in Section~\ref{sec:TODO} is given by Shlens\cite{Shlens2014}.
Recent applications and variants of PCA are explored by Jolliffe et. al.\cite{Jolliffe2016}.

A short discussion on the limitations of PCA as well as example in which PCA fails is given by Shlens\cite{Shlens2014}.
One of the limitations mentioned is that the given data must be linearly dependent.
Tenenbaum proposes a non-linear method to combat this problem\cite{Tenenbaum2000}.

Generally speaking the variables must not have third or higher order dependencies between them. In order to reduce a problem dealing with higher order dependencies to a second order one, where we can use PCA as described in this paper, we can transform the data beforehand. This method is called kernel PCA\cite{Shlens2014}.

Another method for combating this problem is Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which is discussed by Naik~et.~al.\cite{Naik2011}.

In his book Ganong describes typical patterns observed in electroencephalogram (EEG) data of a sleeping person\cite{Ganong1997}. He explains the EEG patterns associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep, which is further partitioned into Stage~1 up to Stage~4.
\\
\\
The given problem of distinguishing sleep stages given some EEG data has been investigated by use of PCA as well as neural networks. Some of these works are summarized here.

A review of different methods in the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification is given by Boostani\cite{Boostani2017}.

Tăuţan et. al.\cite{Tautan2021} compare different methods of dimensionality reduction on EEG data, such as PCA, factor analysis and autoencoders. They conclude that PCA and factor analysis improves the accuracy of the model.

Putilov\cite{Putilov2015} used PCA to find boundaries between Stage~1, Stage~2 and Stage~3. Changes in the first two PC were related to changes between the Stage~1 and Stage~2, while changes in the fourth PC exhibited a change in sign at the boundary of Stage~2 and Stage~3.

Metzner et. al.\cite{Metzner2023} try a machine learning approach to try to rediscover the different human-defined-stages. They find that using PCA on the results makes clusters apparent.

The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challange 2018 was a competition using a similar data\cite{Ghassemi2018}. The goal was to identify arousal during sleep from EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG and SaO2 data given. The winning paper of this competition describes the use of a dense recurrent convolutional neural network (DRCNN) consisting of multiple dense convolutional layers, a bidirectional long-short term memory layer and a softmax output layer\cite{Howe2018}.

There seems to be promising results showing that using PCA is a valid approach in distinguishing sleep stages.
