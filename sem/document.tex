\section{Introduction}

\section{Study of Literature}
\label{sec:study_of_literature}
A substantial body of scientific research has been devoted to exploring Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The foundation of this method was laid by Pearson\cite{Pearson1901} and Hotelling\cite{Hotelling1933}.

An introduction to PCA as well as a good overview on how to derive the formula used to compute the Principal Components (PC) used in Section~\ref{sec:TODO} is given by Shlens\cite{Shlens2014}.
Recent applications and variants of PCA are explored by Jolliffe et. al.\cite{Jolliffe2016}.

A short discussion on the limitations of PCA as well as example in which PCA fails is given by Shlens\cite{Shlens2014}.
One of the limitations mentioned is that the given data must be linearly dependent.
Tenenbaum proposes a non-linear method to combat this problem\cite{Tenenbaum2000}.

Generally speaking the variables must not have third or higher order dependencies between them. In order to reduce a problem dealing with higher order dependencies to a second order one, where we can use PCA as described in this paper, we can transform the data beforehand. This method is called kernel PCA\cite{Shlens2014}.

Another method for combating this problem is Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which is discussed by Naik~et.~al.\cite{Naik2011}.
