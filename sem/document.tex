[TODO general introduction]

\subsection{EEG Data and Sleep Stages}

Ganong~\cite{Ganong1997} describes typical patterns observed in electroencephalogram (EEG) data of a sleeping person. He describes the EEG patterns associated with rapid eye movement~(REM) sleep and non-REM~(NREM) sleep.

NREM sleep is further partitioned into four (although some only use three) stages, termed Stage~1 (S1) to Stage~4 (S4). Example EEG data of these different sleep stages can be seen in Figure~\ref{pic:TODO} [TODO image]. The EEG data of these stages is characterized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label={S\arabic*:}]
\item low-amplitude, high-frequency
\item appearance of sleep spindles (bursts of higher amplitude, lower frequency waves)
\item increased amplitude, lower frequency
\item maximal amplitude, minimal frequency
\end{enumerate}

In REM sleep the EEG data is that of high frequency and low amplitude patterns, resembling the data observed in alert humans.

A substantial body of scientific research has been devoted to exploring Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The foundation of this method was laid by Pearson~\cite{Pearson1901} and Hotelling~\cite{Hotelling1933}.

An introduction to PCA, as well as a good overview on how to derive the formula used to compute the Principal Components (PC) is given by Shlens~\cite{Shlens2014}.
Recent applications and variants of PCA are explored by Jolliffe et. al.~\cite{Jolliffe2016}.

Shlens discusses the limitations of PCA, as well as examples in which PCA fails~\cite{Shlens2014}, such as the requirement of linearly dependent data.
Tenenbaum proposes a non-linear method to combat this problem\cite{Tenenbaum2000}.

Generally speaking the variables must not have third or higher order dependencies\footnote{e.g. $\mathbb{E}[x_ix_jx_k] \neq 0$ for some $i, j, k$ assuming mean-free variables} between them. In some cases it is possible to reduce a problem with higher order dependencies to a second order one by applying a non-linear transformation beforehand. This method is called kernel PCA\cite{Shlens2014}.

Another method for combating this problem is Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which is discussed by Naik~et.~al.\cite{Naik2011}.
\\

The given problem of distinguishing sleep stages given some EEG data has been investigated by use of PCA, as well as neural networks. Some of these works are summarized below.

A review of different methods in the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification is given by Boostani et. al.\cite{Boostani2017}. They find that using a random forest classifier and entropy of wavelet coefficients as feature gives the best results.

Tăuţan et. al.\cite{Tautan2021} compare different methods of dimensionality reduction on EEG data, such as PCA, factor analysis and autoencoders. They conclude that PCA and factor analysis improves the accuracy of the model.

Putilov\cite{Putilov2015} used PCA to find boundaries between Stage~1, Stage~2 and Stage~3. Changes in the first two PC were related to changes between the Stage~1 and Stage~2, while changes in the fourth PC exhibited a change in sign at the boundary of Stage~2 and Stage~3. This suggests that changes between Stage~1 and Stage~2 are easier to detect that ones between Stage~2 and Stage~3.

Metzner et. al.\cite{Metzner2023} try to rediscover the different human-defined sleep stages. They find that using PCA on the results makes clusters apparent. These clusters could then be used as a basis for a redefinition of sleep stages.

The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challange 2018 was a competition using a similar data\cite{Ghassemi2018}. The goal was to identify arousal during sleep from EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG and SaO2 data given. The winning paper of this competition describes the use of a dense recurrent convolutional neural network (DRCNN) consisting of multiple dense convolutional layers, a bidirectional long-short term memory layer and a softmax output layer\cite{Howe2018}.

As shown in this section, the utilization of PCA to analyze EEG data has been used with success.

\section{Mathematical Basics}
\label{sec:mathematical_basics}

We define mathematical notation, which will be used in Section~\ref{sec:principal_component_analysis} to define the PCA.

\subsection{Covariance}
Assume we have two sets of $n$ observations of variables with mean 0. Let us call the first list of observations $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, ..., a_n)$ and the second $\mathbf{b} = (b_1, ..., b_n)$.

\begin{definition}[covariance]
Let us define the \textit{covariance} of $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ as
\begin{align*}
	\sigma_{\mathbf{ab}} := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ib_i = \frac{1}{n}\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}^T.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

From the definition it is obvious that the covariance is symmetric, $\sigma_{\mathbf{ab}} = \sigma_{\mathbf{ba}}$. In the special case $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}$ the covariance $\sigma_{\mathbf{aa}}$ is called \textit{variance} $\sigma_{\mathbf{a}}^2$.

\begin{definition}[covariance matrix]
Generalizing to $m$ variables $\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{x_1}, ..., \mathbf{x_m}]$, each having been observed $n$ times, gives us the \textit{covariance matrix}.

\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{C_X} := \left(\begin{matrix}
		\sigma_{\mathbf{x_1x_1}}	& \cdots & \sigma_{\mathbf{x_1x_m}}	\\
		\vdots						& \ddots & \vdots					\\
		\sigma_{\mathbf{x_mx_1}}	& \cdots & \sigma_{\mathbf{x_mx_m}}	\\
	\end{matrix}\right) = \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

The covariance matrix is a symmetric $m\times m$ matrix.

\subsection{Diagonalizable Matrix}

\begin{definition}[Diagonalizable Matrix]
	A square matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is called \textit{diagonalizable}, if there exists a invertable matrix $\mathbf{P}$ and a diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ such that $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{P}^{-1}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Every symmetric matrix is diagonalizable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors]
	Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a real $m\times m$ matrix. $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is called a \textit{eigenvalue} with \textit{eigenvector} $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^m\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}$ if
	\begin{align}
		\label{eq:def_eigenvalue}
		\mathbf{Av} = \lambda \mathbf{v}.
	\end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Every square $m\times m$ matrix has $m$ eigenvalues.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We can rewrite equation~\ref{eq:def_eigenvalue} as
	\begin{align*}
		(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}
	\end{align*}
	
	As $\mathbf{v} \neq 0$ we are interested in values for $\lambda$ in which $\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0$. The left hand side is a polynomial of degree $m$ which can be expressed in the form $(\lambda - \lambda_1)...(\lambda - \lambda_m)$ with $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_m \in \mathbb{C}$. These $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_m$ are the $m$ eigenvalues we wanted to find.
	
\end{proof}
